# A simple bash script to clone all the necessary odoo versions,
# both community and enterprise, at the same time
# 
# BEWARE, this scripts opens one new terminal window for each git command
# that stays open until it is closed. Also the parent process waits for the
# child processes to end. You can kill the parent process and the child
# processes will also be killed.
# 
# This is the assumed folder structure:
# ├─ odoo
# |  ├─ 13.0 <odoo version>
# |  |  ├── odoo
# |  |  |   <community edition source code>
# |  |  ├── enterprise
# |  |  |   <enterprise edition source code>
# |  ├─ 14.0 <another odoo version>
# |  |  ├── odoo
# |  |  |   <community edition source code>
# |  |  ├── enterprise
# |  |  |   <enterprise edition source code>
# |  ├─ <etc>
# ├─ Scripts (or whatever name you fancy)
# |  ├─ <where this script is expected to be housed
